We ask that you please contact us if you have any concerns or feedback. This Provision facilitates the prompt and efficient resolution of any disputes that may arise between you and Float Note. Arbitration is a form of private dispute resolution in which persons with a dispute waive their rights to file a lawsuit, to proceed in court and to a jury trial, and instead submit their disputes to a neutral third person (or arbitrator) for a binding decision. You have the right to opt-out of this Provision (as explained below), which means you would retain your right to litigate your disputes in a court, either before a judge or jury. This provision provides that all Disputes between you and Float Note shall be resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration replaces the right to go to court. In the absence of this arbitration agreement, you may otherwise have a right or opportunity to bring claims in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate in or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including, but not limited to, class actions). Except as otherwise provided, entering into this agreement constitutes a waiver of your right to litigate claims and all opportunity to be heard by a judge or jury. There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. The arbitrator must follow this agreement and can award the same damages and relief as a court (including attorney’s fees). For the purpose of this Provision, “Float Note” means Float Note and its parents, subsidiary, and affiliate companies, and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, contractors and agents. The term “Dispute” means any dispute, claim, or controversy between you and Float Note regarding any aspect of your relationship with Float Note, whether based in contract, statute, regulation, ordinance, tort (including, but not limited to, fraud, misrepresentation, fraudulent inducement, or negligence), or any other legal or equitable theory, and includes the validity, enforceability or scope of this Provision (with the exception of the enforceability of the Class Action Waiver clause below). “Dispute” is to be given the broadest possible meaning that will be enforced, and shall include any claims against other parties relating to services or products provided or billed to you (such as Float Note’s licensors, suppliers, dealers or third-party vendors) whenever you also assert claims against us in the same proceeding. \n WE EACH AGREE THAT, EXCEPT AS PROVIDED BELOW, ANY AND ALL DISPUTES, AS DEFINED ABOVE, WHETHER PRESENTLY IN EXISTENCE OR BASED ON ACTS OR OMISSIONS IN THE PAST OR IN THE FUTURE, WILL BE RESOLVED EXCLUSIVELY AND FINALLY BY BINDING ARBITRATION RATHER THAN IN COURT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS PROVISION. \n \n -- Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution -- \n For all Disputes, whether pursued in court or arbitration, you must first give Float Note an opportunity to resolve the Dispute. You must commence this process by mailing written notification to Float Note, 1102 Century Oak Drive, Frederickburg VA, 22401. That written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, (3) a written description of your Claim, and (4) a description of the specific relief you seek. If Float Note does not resolve the Dispute within 45 days after it receives your written notification, you may pursue your Dispute in arbitration. You may pursue your Dispute in a court only under the circumstances described below. \n \n -- Exclusions from Arbitration/Right to Opt Out -- \n Notwithstanding the above, you or Float Note may choose to pursue a Dispute in court and not by arbitration if (a) given the nature and amount of the Dispute, it may be initiated in small claims court; or (b) YOU OPT-OUT OF THESE ARBITRATION PROCEDURES WITHIN 30 DAYS FROM THE DATE THAT YOU FIRST CONSENT TO THIS AGREEMENT (the “Opt-Out Deadline”). You may opt out of this Provision by mailing written notification to Float Note 1102 Centruy Oak Drive, Fredericksburg VA, 22401. Your written notification must include (1) your name, (2) your address, and (3) a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Float Note through arbitration. Your decision to opt-out of this Arbitration Provision will have no adverse effect on your relationship with Float Note. Any opt-out request received after the Opt-Out Deadline will not be valid and you must pursue your Dispute in arbitration or small claims court. \n \n -- Arbitration Procedures -- \n Arbitration Organization: If this Provision applies and the Dispute is not resolved as provided above (Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution) either you or Float Note may initiate arbitration proceedings. The American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), http://www.adr.org/ , or JAMS, http://www.jamsadr.com/ , will arbitrate all Disputes, and the arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator. The arbitration shall be commenced as an individual arbitration, and shall in no event be commenced as a class arbitration. All issues shall be for the arbitrator to decide, including the scope of this Provision. For arbitration before AAA, for Disputes of less than $75,000, the AAA’s Supplementary Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes will apply; for Disputes involving $75,000 or more, the AAA’s Commercial Arbitration Rules will apply. In either instance, the AAA’s Optional Rules for Emergency Measures of Protection shall apply. The AAA rules are available at www.adr.org or by calling 1-800-778-7879. For arbitration before JAMS, the JAMS Comprehensive Arbitration Rules & Procedures and the JAMS Recommended Arbitration Discovery Protocols for Domestic, Commercial Cases will apply. The JAMS rules are available at http://www.jamsadr.com/ or by calling 1-800-352-5267. This Provision governs in the event it conflicts with the applicable arbitration rules. Under no circumstances will class action procedures or rules apply to the arbitration. \n -- Because the Services and these Terms concern interstate commerce, the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) governs the arbitrability of all Disputes. However, the arbitrator will apply applicable substantive law consistent with the FAA and the applicable statute of limitations or condition precedent to suit. Arbitration Award: The arbitrator may award on an individual basis any relief that would be available pursuant to applicable law, and will not have the power to award relief to, against or for the benefit of any person who is not a party to the proceeding. The arbitrator will make any award in writing but need not provide a statement of reasons unless requested by a party. Such award will be final and binding on the parties, except for any right of appeal provided by the FAA, and may be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the parties for purposes of enforcement. Location of Arbitration: You or Float Note may initiate arbitration in either Fredericksburg, Virginia, or the federal judicial district that includes your billing address. In the event that you select the federal judicial district that includes your billing address, Float Note may transfer the arbitration to Frederickburg, Virginia in the event that it agrees to pay any additional fees or costs you incur as a result of the transfer, as determined by the arbitrator. \n Payment of Arbitration Fees and Costs: Float Note will pay all arbitration filing fees and arbitrator’s costs and expenses upon your written request given prior to the commencement of the arbitration. You are responsible for all additional fees and costs that you incur in the arbitration, including, but not limited to, attorneys or expert witnesses. Fees and costs may be awarded as provided pursuant to applicable law. In addition to any rights to recover fees and costs under applicable law, if you provide notice and negotiate in good faith with Float Note as provided in the section above titled “Pre-Arbitration Claim Resolution” and the arbitrator concludes that you are the prevailing party in the arbitration, you will be entitled to recover reasonable attorney’s fees and costs as determined by the arbitrator. \n \n -- Class Action Waiver -- \n Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a class or representative proceeding or claims (such as a class action, consolidated action or private attorney general action) unless both you and Float Note specifically agree to do so following initiation of the arbitration. If you choose to pursue your Dispute in court by opting out of the Arbitration Provision, as specified above, this Class Action Waiver will not apply to you. Neither you, nor any other user of the Services can be a class representative, class member, or otherwise participate in a class, consolidated, or representative proceeding without having complied with the opt-out requirements above. \n \n -- Jury Waiver -- \n You understand and agree that by entering into this Agreement you and Float Note are each waiving the right to a jury trial or a trial before a judge in a public court. In the absence of this Provision, you and Float Note might otherwise have had a right or opportunity to bring Disputes in a court, before a judge or jury, and/or to participate or be represented in a case filed in court by others (including class actions). Except as otherwise provided in this Provision, those rights are waived. Other rights that you would have if you went to court, such as the right to appeal and to certain types of discovery, may be more limited or may also be waived. \n \n -- Severability -- \n If any clause within this Provision (other than the Class Action Waiver clause above) is found to be illegal or unenforceable, that clause will be severed from this Provision, and the remainder of this Provision will be given full force and effect. If the Class Action Waiver clause is found to be illegal or unenforceable, this entire Provision will be unenforceable and the Dispute will be decided by a court.\n \n -- Continuation -- \n This Provision shall survive the termination of your service with Float Note or its affiliates. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, we agree that if Float Note makes any change to this Provision (other than a change to the Notice Address), you may reject any such change and require Float Note to adhere to the language in this Provision if a dispute between us arises. \n \n -- General -- \n The Federal Arbitration Act, Georgia state law and applicable U.S. federal law, without regard to the choice or conflicts of law provisions, will govern these Terms. Foreign laws do not apply. The United Nations on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods and any laws based on the Uniform Computer Information Transactions Act (UCITA) shall not apply to this Agreement. Except for Disputes subject to arbitration as described above, any disputes relating to these Terms or the Services will be heard in the courts located in Fredericksburg, Virginia. If any of these Terms is found to be inconsistent with applicable law, then such term shall be interpreted to reflect the intentions of the parties, and no other terms will be modified. Float Note’s failure to enforce any of these Terms is not a waiver of such term. These Terms are the entire agreement between you and Float Note and supersede all prior or contemporaneous negotiations, discussions or agreements between you and Float Note about the Services. The proprietary rights, disclaimer of warranties, representations made by you, indemnities, limitations of liability and general provisions shall survive any termination of these Terms. \n \n -- Copyright Policy -- \n Float Note respects the intellectual property rights of others. If you believe that your intellectual property appears on the Services in violation of your copyright, please provide Float Note’s designated agent the following information: A physical or electronic signature of a person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. Identification of the work claimed to have been infringed, or, if multiple works at a single online site are covered by a single notification, a representative list of such works at that site. Identification of the material that is claimed to be infringing or to be the subject of infringing activity and that is to be removed or access to which is to be disabled at the Services, and information reasonably sufficient to permit Float Note to locate the material. Information reasonably sufficient to permit Float Note to contact you as the complaining party, such as an address, telephone number, and, if available, an electronic mail address at which you may be contacted. A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the intellectual property owner, its agent, or the law. A statement that the information in the notification is accurate, and under penalty of perjury, that you are authorized to act on behalf of the owner of an exclusive right that is allegedly infringed. We will notify you that we have removed or disabled access to copyright-protected material that you provided, if such removal is pursuant to a valid DMCA take-down notice that we have received. If you receive such notice from us, you may provide us with a counter-notification in writing to Float Note designated agent that includes all of the following information: Your physical or electronic signature; Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access has been disabled, and the location at which the material appeared before it was removed or access to it was disabled; A statement from you under the penalty of perjury, that you have a good faith belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of a mistake or misidentification; and Your name, physical address and telephone number, and a statement that you consent to the jurisdiction of a court for the judicial district in which your physical address is located, or if your physical address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which Float Note may be located, and that you will accept service of process from the person who provided notification of allegedly infringing material or an agent of such person. \n \n -- Contact Us -- \n If you have any questions about these Terms or otherwise need to contact Float Note for any reason, you can reach us at kmt8vn@virginia.edu."
